> Deprivation indices in the UK.


This provides code and data for UK indices of deprivation.

It will support:

* the [Welsh Index of Deprivation](https://gov.wales/welsh-index-multiple-deprivation)
* the English Index of Deprivation
* adjusted UK indices of deprivation 2016 using the resources generated by 
[Gary Abel, Rupert Payne, Matt Barclay (2016): UK Deprivation Indices.](https://doi.org/10.5523/bris.1ef3q32gybk001v77c1ifmty7x).
* [Indices of Deprivation: income and employment domains combined for England and Wales (since 2019)](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/indices-of-deprivation-2019-income-and-employment-domains-combined-for-england-and-wales)
* [MySociety adjusted UK indices of deprivation 2020](https://github.com/mysociety/composite_uk_imd) using the same
approach as per Abel, Payne and Barclay but for 2020.

Essentially, the "Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation" and the "English Index of Multiple Deprivation" are not easily
comparable. Each generates a rank based on a geographical region called an LSOA (Lower Layer Super Output Area) but the
top rank in Wales is not equivalent to the top rank in England. 

There are harmonised indices of deprivation, based on income and employment, combined for England and Wales.
See [https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/indices-of-deprivation-2019-income-and-employment-domains-combined-for-england-and-wales](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/indices-of-deprivation-2019-income-and-employment-domains-combined-for-england-and-wales).

The adjusted indices data are available:

# Background

We know socio-economic deprivation has a significant effect on health outcomes. 

We make rankings based on a wide-range of parameters and need to be able to harmonise across geographic boundaries.

Individual indices for a geographic region, such as England or for Wales, are available. If you are studying a 
population from a single region, you can use the index for that region. Indices are available are available for
a range of domains, and usually include a composite index providing a view across multiple domains.

However, if your study population is from multiple areas, you cannot use disparate indices and assume rank 1 in, for example
England, is the same as rank 1 in Wales. Likewise, you cannot assume the upper quartile in England is equivalent
to the upper quartile in Wales. 

The work by Abel, Payne and Barclay provides a way to harmonise across England and Wales, but there is also indices 
based on income and employment, published for England and Wales. Abel, Payne and Barclay published a composite UK
index for 2016, and [MySociety have used the same approach](https://github.com/mysociety/composite_uk_imd) for 2020.

In practical terms, whichever index used, most studies will not want to use ranks directly, but instead use quartiles 
or quintiles.

# What is this repository?

This repository provides a way to automatically download and make those data available in computing systems. 
It is designed to be composable with other data and computing services in a graph-like API. 
In essence, it provides a simple way to lookup a deprivation index based on LSOA. 
A LSOA is a small defined geographical area of the UK containing about 1500 people designed to help report small
area statistics.
You can use [nhspd](https://github.com/wardle/nhspd) to map from a UK postal code to an LSOA.
