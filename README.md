> Deprivation indices in the UK.


This provides code and data for adjusted UK indices of deprivation using the resources generated by 
[Gary Abel, Rupert Payne, Matt Barclay (2016): UK Deprivation Indices.](https://doi.org/10.5523/bris.1ef3q32gybk001v77c1ifmty7x).

Essentially, the "Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation" and the "English Index of Multiple Deprivation" are not easily
comparable. Each generates a rank based on a geographical region called an LSOA (Lower Layer Super Output Area) but the
top rank in Wales is not equivalent to the top rank in England.

# Background

We know socio-economic deprivation has a significant effect on health outcomes. 
We make rankings based on a wide-range of parameters and need to be able to harmonise across geographic boundaries.

The excellent work by Abel, Payne and Barclay provides a way to do that. 

# What is this repository?

This repository provides a way to automatically download and make those data available in computing systems. 
It is designed to be composable with other data and computing services in a graph-like API. 
In essence, it provides a simple way to lookup a deprivation index based on LSOA.
